# NeuromicsCellDetection
This is the source code for the neuromics project. 
## About
This is developed for [Cortical Processing Laboratory](https://www.google.com) at UCL (though I am from [Oxford physics](https://www2.physics.ox.ac.uk/contacts/people/peng))... 

Introductory webpage: https://ha-ha-ha-han.github.io//projects/neuro/

A brief introduction with demo data will be put in the repository soon.
